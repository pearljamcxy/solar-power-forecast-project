Module 2 transforms traditional KPI-based monitoring into a diagnostic and predictive framework.
By constructing Expected DC/AC and tracking deviations, we can:

・Detect inverter faults

・Quantify economic losses

・Observe long-term degradation

・Prioritize maintenance actions

・Provide real, actionable insights for operational teams

This module forms the foundation for advanced ML techniques in Module 3, such as anomaly detection and time-series forecasting.
